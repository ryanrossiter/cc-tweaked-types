# cc-tweaked-types
Typescript definitions for making code that can be transpiled to CC: Tweaked varient ComputerCraft Lua Code for computing in minecraft

This is a work in progress.

If you want some part of the api to be included that I have not written the types for please submit an issue ticket and I will try to get to it asap.

I am defining the types as I need them so I don't go crazy doing them all at once.

## **TO INSTALL:**
Add this to the `compilerOptions` of your tsconfig:
```json
"types": ["cc-tweaked-types", "typescript-to-lua/language-extensions"],
```
